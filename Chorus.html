  <p>Varsity Singers, here at HCHS, sing songs from a select genre each year.The Chorus group performs 
  concerts, competions, and other events to inspire or challenge the member in it.<br />This year, 2017, the Chorus'
 competition group  earned a 1 at a competition(which is the best score on a 1 to 3 scale ) they went to. What are the varsity singers you 
  may ask? They are a group of singers that go beyond expectations and are willing to compete in any compatition.
