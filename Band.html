<p>   The HCHS band is named The Pride because we perform with pride. We travel to different places for football games,
 concerts, contests, and festivals.</p>

<p>We have about one houndred and fourty-five band members. We consist of trumpets, clarinets, 
trumbones, baritones(Treble and Bass cleft), tubas, saxophones (tenor, alto, and baritone ), flutes, and piccalo.</p>
<p> Currently we are finishing up our marching season. Soon we will begin our concert season 
and work on more music as well as getting ready for concerts.</p></div>
